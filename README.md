# Learn By Solving

Learn programming by solving real-world problems.

In this repository I added different real-world problems for anyone who likes
to learn programming by solving real world problems.

Based on my experience, when you try to solve a problem your coding skills
will imrove drastically in long-term. You have some knowledge about the language and
the framework, but up until you use them, those knowledge don't contribute to your
professional abilities.

The problems are chosen based on my daily experience as a developer and also by the 
potential value they can add to your skill sets.

For each problem, a solution in C# is provided by me, it doesn't have to be the 
best possible implementation in terms of design and performance, although I do 
my best to address them in the corresponding video I will record. It would be nice
if you code in a different langauge and provide your solution to the problems 
as part of pull requests.

If you enjoyed the problems and learnt any from them, I would appreciate it if you
share this repository with your friends who may like it.

Happy Coding :rose:
